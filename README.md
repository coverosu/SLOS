# SLOS

Simple local osu! server

Basically the goal of this little repo is just to make a barebones version of [LOS](https://github.com/coverosu/local-osu-server) and literally focus on a "better offline experience"

devserver domain is `coverbancho.tk`

not gonna have much support for this unless this gets attention (I don't see how this will)
